# Java-in-Action-Lab 
**Developed at devCodeCamp** 
A console-based Java application re-creating the "Robot versus Dinosaur" fighting game, originally inspired by a JavaScript exercise. This project demonstrates the structural and syntactic similarities between Java and Python, reinforcing cross-language programming fundamentals.

--- 
## Features 
- Turn-based fighting mechanics: Robot vs. Dinosaur gameplay in the console
- Practice in writing core game logic using Java methods
- Illustrates parallels in syntax and logic between Python, JavaScript, and Java
- Modular code for easy adaptation and extension

--- 

## Technologies Used 
- Java
--- 

## Installation 
1. **Clone the repository:** ``` git clone https://github.com/thompsonmikej/Java-in-Action-Lab.git cd Java-in-Action-Lab ```
2. **Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.**
3. **Run the main Java file to start the game.**

## Usage 
- Launch the program from your terminal or IDE.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to control the robot or dinosaur in battle.
- Each turn, select actions and view results directly in the console. 
--- 

## Challenges & Lessons Learned 
- Reinforced understanding of Java application structure compared to JavaScript and Python.
- Adapted core gameplay mechanics to Java, learning how language syntax and object orientation translate across languages.
- Enhanced skills in modular design and code readability.
--- 

## Future Improvements 
- Expand game features with more actions, enemies, or power-ups.
- Develop a simple GUI for enhanced user interaction.
- Implement persistent score-tracking or player customization options.
